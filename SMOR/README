Introdution
===========
This is the German finite-state transducer morphology SMOR (including
a comprehensive lexicon) which was developed at the Institut für
maschinelle Sprachverarbeitung (IMS) of the University of Stuttgart.

SMOR covers inflection, derivation and compounding and achieves good
coverage. It is implemented with SFST, a finite-state transducer toolkit
developed by Helmut Schmid at IMS.

SMOR analyzes German word forms and returns information about the
lemma, part-of-speech and morphological features such as number,
gender, case tense etc. and also information about morphemes.

=====
Usage
=====
SMOR can be used via one of the three shell scripts located in the
main directory of this package:

smor: This script calls SMOR interactively and supports analysis as
      well as generation of word forms. After starting the script, you
      can enter any word form and you will get the full set of
      possible analyses. Each analysis shows you the stems and
      derivational morphemes contained in a word form as well as its
      morphological features. By entering an empty line, you can
      switch into generation mode. Now you can enter morphological
      analyses and obtain the corresponding word forms.

Here is an example session:
> ./smor

smor-infl: This script is similar to smor but differs in four aspects:
           It is intended for batch usage and reads its input from a
           file. It supports analysis, but not generation. It returns
           only the least complex analyses and not all analyses. And
           it is able to recognise some non-standard writings: Taking
           the word "grüßt" as an example, smor-infl would also be
           able to analyse "Grüßt", "GRÜSST", and "gruesst". It also
           has heuristics to recognise certain propernames such as
           street names ending in "...straße".

Here is an example:
> echo Häuserblöcke | ./smor-infl 
> Häuserblöcke
Haus<NN>Block<+NN><Masc><Nom><Pl>
Haus<NN>Block<+NN><Masc><Gen><Pl>
Haus<NN>Block<+NN><Masc><Acc><Pl>

smor-lemmatizer: This script return the lemma, part-of-speech, and
                 morphological features of a word form, but no
                 information about word formation (derivation,
                 composition). Part-of-speech and morphological
                 features follow the STTS tagging schema.

Here is an example:
> echo Häuserblöcke | ./smor-lemmatizer 

Häuserblöcke    NN.Masc.Nom.Pl Häuserblock
Häuserblöcke    NN.Masc.Gen.Pl Häuserblock
Häuserblöcke    NN.Masc.Acc.Pl Häuserblock

===============
Troubleshooting
===============
These scripts call the binaries located in the subdirectory bin.  If
you have problems with missing libraries or other problems with the
binaries, you can download the SFST package at
http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/SFST, compile it and
replace fst-mor and fst-infl2 with the new binaries.


===================
Directory structure
===================
The other data is organised as follows:

bin: directory containing binaries of the the SFST programs that are
     needed to use SMOR

lib: directory containing the compiled SMOR transducers

perl: auxiliary Perl scripts used by the shell scripts
